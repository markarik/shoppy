                    The education and training of a health workforce contributes to the quality of services that
                    health workers provide to their communities. However, many countries lack information about
                    health worker training, both preservice and in-service, making it difficult to track, plan, and

                    health system inefficiencies and reduces health worker effectiveness.</p>
